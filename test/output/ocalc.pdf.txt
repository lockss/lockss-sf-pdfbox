Dear editor,
I am please d to see so much serious attention being given to improvements in the way calculus has
traditionally been taught, but I’m surprised that nobody has been discussing the kinds of changes
that I personal ly believe would be most valuable. If I were responsible for teaching calculus to
college undergr aduates and advanced high school students today, and if I had the opportunity to
deviat e from the existing textb ooks, I would certain ly make major changes by emphasizing several
notational improvements that advanced mathematicians have been using for more than a hundred
years.
The most important of these changes would be to introduce the O notation and related ideas at an
early stage. This notati on, first used by Bachmann in 1894 and later popularized by Landau, has
the great virtue that it makes calculations simpler, so it simplifies many parts of the subject, yet
it is highly intuitive and easily learned. The key idea is to be able to deal with quantities that are
only partly specified, and to use them in the midst of formulas.
I would begin my ideal calculus course by introducing a simpler “A notation,” which means “abso-
lutely at most.” For exampl e, A(2) stands for a quantity whose absolute value is less than or equal
to 2. This notati on has a natural connection with decimal numbers: Saying that pi is approximately
3.14 is equivalent to saying that pi = 3.14 + A(.005). Students will easily discover how to calculate
with A:
10A(2) = A(100) ;parenleftbig
3.14 + A(.005)parenrightbigparenleftbig1 + A(0.01)parenrightbig
= 3.14 + A(.005) + A(0.0314) + A(.00005)
= 3.14 + A(0.3645) = 3.14 + A(.04) .
I would of course explain that the equality sign is not symm etric with respect to such notation s;
we have 3 = A(5) and 4 = A(5) but not 3 = 4, nor can we say that A(5) = 4. We can, however,
say that A(0) = 0. As de Bruijn points out in [1, §1.2], mathematic ians customaril y use the = sign
as they use the word “is” in English: Aristotle is a man, but a man isn’t necessarily Aristotle.
The A notation applies to variable quantities as well as to constant ones. For exampl e,
sin x = A(1) ;
x = A(x);
A(x) = xA(1) ;
A(x) + A(y) = A(x + y) if x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0;parenleftbig
1 + A(t)parenrightbig2 = 1 + 3A(t) if t = A(1) .
Once students have caught on to the idea of A notation, they are ready for O notation, which is even
less specific. In its simplest form, O(x) stands for somethin g that is CA(x) for some constan t C,
but we don’t say what C is. We also define side conditions on the variables that appear in the
formulas. For example, if n is a positive integer we can say that any quadratic polynomial in n is
1
O(n2). If n is sufficien tly large, we can deduce that
parenleftbign + O(√n )parenrightbigparenleftbigln n + γ + O(1/n)parenrightbig
= n ln n + γn + O(1)
+ O(√n ln n) + O(√n ) + O(1/√n )
= n ln n + γn + O(√n ln n).
I would define the derivative by first defining what might be called a “stron g derivative”: The
function f has a strong derivative fprime(x) at point x if
f(x + epsilon1) = f(x) + fprime(x)epsilon1 + O(epsilon12)
whenev er epsilon1 is sufficiently small. The vast majority of all function s that arise in practical work have
strong derivatives, so I believe this definition best captures the intuition I want students to have
about derivatives. We see immediately, for example, that if f(x) = x2 we have
(x + epsilon1)2 = x2 + 2xepsilon1 + epsilon12 ,
so the derivative of x2 is 2x. And if the derivative of xn is dn(x), we have
(x + epsilon1)n+1 = (x + epsilon1)parenleftbigxn + dn(x)epsilon1 + O(epsilon12)parenrightbig
= xn+1 + parenleftbigxdn(x) + xnparenrightbigepsilon1 + O(epsilon12);
hence the derivative of xn+1 is xdn(x)+xn and we find by induction that dn(x) = nxn−1. Similarly
if f and g have strong derivatives fprime(x) and gprime(x), we readily find
f(x + epsilon1)g(x + epsilon1) = f(x)g(x) + parenleftbigfprime(x)g(x) + f(x)gprime(x)parenrightbigepsilon1 + O(epsilon12)
and this gives the strong derivative of the product. The chain rule
fparenleftbigg(x + epsilon1)parenrightbig = fparenleftbigg(x)parenrightbig + fprimeparenleftbigg(x)parenrightbiggprime(x)epsilon1 + O(epsilon12)
also follows when f has a strong derivative at point g(x) and g has a strong derivative at x.
Once it is known that integrat ion is the inverse of differen tiation and related to the area under a
curve, we can observe, for exampl e, that if f and fprime both have strong derivatives at x, then
f(x + epsilon1) − f(x) =
integraldisplay epsilon1
0
fprime(x + t)dt
=
integraldisplay epsilon1
0
parenleftbigfprime(x) + fprimeprime(x)t + O(t2)parenrightbig dt
= fprime(x)epsilon1 + fprimeprime(x)epsilon12/2 + O(epsilon13).
I’m sure it would be a pleasure for both students and teacher if calculus were taught in this way.
The extra time needed to introduce O notation is amply repaid by the simpli fications that occur
later. In fact, there probably will be time to introduce the “o notation, ” which is equivalent to the
taking of limits, and to give the general definition of a not-necessarily-strong derivative:
f(x + epsilon1) = f(x) + fprime(x)epsilon1 + o(epsilon1).
2
The function f is continuous at x if
f(x + epsilon1) = f(x) + o(1) ;
and so on. But I would not mind leaving a full exploration of such things to a more advanced
course , when it will easily be picked up by anyone who has learned the basics with O alone. Indeed,
I have not needed to use “o” in 2200 pages of The Art of Compu ter Programm ing, although many
techniques of advanced calculus are applied throughout those books to a great variety of problems .
Students will be motivated to use O notation for two important reasons. First, it significantly
simplifies calculations because it allows us to be sloppy—but in a satisfactorily controlled way.
Second , it appears in the power series calculations of symbolic algebra systems like Maple and
Mathematica, which today’s students will surely be using.
For more than 20 years I have dreamed of writing a calculus text entitled O Calculus, in which
the subject would be taught along the lines sketched above. More pressing projects, such as the
developmen t of the TEX system , have made that impossible, although I did try to write a good
introduction to O notation for post-calculus students in [2, Chapt er 9]. Perhaps my ideas are
preposterous, but I’m hoping that this letter will catch the attention of people who are much more
capabl e than I of writing calculus texts for the new millennium. And I hope that some of these
now-classical ideas will prove to be at least half as fruitful for students of the next generation as
they have been for me.
Sincerely,
Donald E. Knuth
